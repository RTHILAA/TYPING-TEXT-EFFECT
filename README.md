# Typing Text Effect Project :

This project demonstrates a simple typing text animation effect for a front-end developer's introduction. The text "Front-End Developer" appears as if it's being typed out, with an infinite loop that reverses direction.

## Features:

- Responsive design with media queries for different screen sizes
- Smooth typing animation using CSS keyframes
- Clean, centered layout with black background
- Red accent color for the animated text

## Technologies Used :

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including animations and flexbox)

## How It Works :

The animation is created using:
1. A `span` element containing the text to be animated
2. CSS `overflow: hidden` to hide the text initially
3. `@keyframes` animation that changes the width from 0 to 100%
4. `steps()` function to create the typing effect
5. `alternate-reverse` to make the animation loop back and forth

## Responsive Design :

The project includes three breakpoints:
1. **Large screens (950px+):** 40px font size
2. **Medium screens (481px-949px):** 30px font size
3. **Small screens (‚â§480px):** 18px font size with adjusted animation speed

## How to Use :

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. The animation will start automatically

## Customization :

To modify the project:
- Change colors in the CSS file
- Adjust animation timing in the `@keyframes` rule
- Modify text content in the HTML file
- Add more media queries for additional breakpoints

## Browser Support :

The project supports all modern browsers including:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
